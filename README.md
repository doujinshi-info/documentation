## Doujinshi.info API Documentation

This is the documentation for using the Doujinshi.info API.

Doujinshi.info is an information database containing data on self-published works known as doujinshi. The goal of the site is to catalog, tag, and categorize as many doujinshi as possible. With this community driven data, we are able to provide interesting statistics regarding the doujinshi scene as a whole. Such as average page counts, most common themes, average prices, etc. Along with this, users are able to catalog their physical doujinshi collections to keep track of what they own, as well as follow their favorite artists, or tags, to discover newly released doujinshi.
